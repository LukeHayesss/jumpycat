# Jumpy Cat!
Say hello to the coolest jumping cat, Mr. Murray. 
This was another one day challenge to build a cute version of the game Doodle Jump, but I decided to call mine Jumpy Cat! Some of the features I like are-
- collision detection, so when the cat lands on a platform, it then jumps up so that we can land on the next one
- the score keeps track of how many platforms we jump past
- if the cat hits the bottom of the game grid, it's game over
- super cute graphics
- keyboard navigation built-in
- pretty much all done in Javascript, with CSS and a bit of HTML
