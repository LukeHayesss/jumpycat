# Jumpy Cat!
Another one day mini-game challenge to build a cute version of Doodle Jump, called Jumpy Cat! 
- collision detection, so when the cat lands on a platform, it then jumps up so that we can land on the next one
- the score keeps track of how many platforms we jump past
- if the cat hits the bottom of the game grid, it's game over
- super cute graphics
- keyboard navigation built-in
- pretty much all done in Javascript, with CSS and a bit of HTML
